# JOB_SEEKER_PROFILE-DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-
Project task: Develop a Python application to manage a recruiter profile database using MySQL. This project  involves creating a database, setting up a table, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update,  Delete) operations via Python code. 

Task Details: 
Database Creation: Create a database named job. 
Table Setup: Within the JOB database, create a table named job_seeker_profile 
Define the table structure as follows: 
TABLE_NAME:  ` job_seeker_profile ` 
OTHER FIELDS: 
user_account_id` int NOT NULL  primary key, 
`city` varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
`country` varchar(255) NOT  NULL, 
`employment_type` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL, 
`first_name` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL, 
`last_name` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL, 
`email` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL, 
`state` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL, 
`phone` varchar(255) ) NOT  NULL  ` 


Python Code Implementation: 
Write a Python script to: 
Connect to the MySQL database. 
Perform all necessary CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on the 
job_seeker_profile table. 
Populate the job_seeker_profile table with records.

User and Privilege Management: 
Create a MySQL user with your name (e.g., your_name). 
Grant the necessary privileges to this user to allow full access to the RECRUITER database, 
including the ability to connect, create, update, delete, and read records from the 
job_seeker_profile table.
